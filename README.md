## Summary

**Hello Squirrel** is an android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel 🐿.**With this project, I learn how to clone a basic application from a GitHub repository, set up an emulator, make changes to the cloned app, and then upload our modifications to our personal repository.**
